/**
 * Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * 1
 * / \
 * 2   3
 * / \  /
 * 4  5 6
 * <p>
 * Output: 6
